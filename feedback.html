A Rabbi friend, as well as my own Rabbi refered me to your sight. 
I was thrilled to find the weekday prayer service in the proper nussach both morning and evening. 
I am comfortable and familiar with shabbat service but do not get the opportunity to daven in a weekday minyan 
and wanted to learn the service. 
<p>
Thank you so much for this incredible service you have provided the Jewish Community. 
Yasher Koach!

Thank you for the creation of such wonderful programs on CD. I have to say that these CDs (although I downloaded mine from iTunes) 
are the best, not to mention the clearest, form of teaching prayers that I have ever come across. For someone who was not brought up 
religiously and does not read nor speak Hebrew, this program has been the best teaching tool of all for me and my entire family. 
So, to all who may be reading this feedback and are debating whether to buy it or not, I say go ahead and do it. You will not be disappointed.
<p>
Thank you again Rabbi Mark Zimmerman for such clear and easy to follow prayers and instructions for both Shabbat and the Holy Days. 
May God Bless you and the work that you do for all “Jews in training” such as myself.

Todah raba a million times. This is wonderful; such a gift for I am sure many of us. 
Once it came to my hands I couldn't stop listening. Going to shul once a week is a 
slow process for learning all the prayers and melodies. This tool makes the path of 
learning one of light, joy and happiness. Shalom,
<p>

Consider this a fan letter. My sons are learning the prayers and we just found the
website with your tutorial. Not only are the lessons/instructions excellent but your
voice is clear and comforting. Brings back memories.
<p>

Thank you.<br>

Rabbi, 
I can't tell you how much I enjoy listening and studying the various weekday and shabbat prayers on your website. 
In a very short time I have been able to learn and lead many of the prayers in my shul. I just wanted to thank you 
for lighting that flame in me...

Rabbi Zimmerman did a wonderful job, and this is a fantastic teaching tool.   I teach an Intro to Judaism class (Derech Torah) 
at the Marcus Atlanta JCC, which many people take to support their conversion to Judaism... this is such a gift for them!!!
&nbsp;Thanks so much.

Dear Rabbi,<p>
I am a man who is trying to reconnect to Judaism. I want to thank you for these fine recordings. 
Over the past several months a spiritual awakening has begun within me but I never learned how to pray as a Jew. 
I have gone from one Beit Kenesset to another and have always gotten so lost that I almost gave up. 
I think your recordings are far more valuable then you know.<br>
Thank you.

I just wanted to drop by and let you know how valuable your site is to me. I was born in Israel, and my family moved to San Francisco in 1984 
(I was a little over a year old, at the time). Two years ago I moved to Miami for college, and I started to become more religious.<p>

Though, my family has always been traditional, and I grew up listening to my father recite Shalom Alechem, Ayshet Chayil, Kidush, etc., 
every Friday night. I realized when I was spending Shabbat with families in Miami Beach that non of the Tfillot actually stuck in my head. 
So I did some research online and after a while I finally found your site.<p>

Now it's part of my everyday schedule (except Shabbat, of course) to sit down in front of my laptop and learn a Tfillah I don't know. 
(Prior to finding your site, I was asking people to record Tfillot for me, so I can listen to them and  learn them). 
The combination of your great voice and beautiful prayer style makes it easy to follow along and memorize.<p>

I am grateful for your site, and all the hard work and  energy,  I am sure you put into making it. <br
Thank you, <p>

E Gigi, San Francisco

Just a quick note to thank you so much for your audio siddur on-line. I just became observant a few months
ago, and your web site is largely to thank for my progress.

<p>As we began to prepare for our daughter's bat mitzvah at our
 Conservative congregation here in central New Jersey, I sat down to
 google an audio recording of birkat ha-mazon and some additional
prayers, to assist some family members just learning these prayers. Our congregation
is still developing  such digital resources -- we do have a 2-CD tefillah collection, as
 well as a recently added zemirot CD for our hebrew school program
 --and eventually came across your recordings. 
<br><br>
 
 Please accept my gratitude and compliments for putting such a clear,
 instructional selection of recordings on the Web. While I had first
 found recordings from several outreach sources, they were
 neither as comprehensive as yours, nor were they consistent with
 modern Conservative practice.  Listening to Rabbi Zimmerman's
recordings will be very helpful.

Dear Rabbi Zimmerman,<br><br>

I just want to thank you for the wonderful help you've given me
that you don't even know about. I have been given an Aliyah at my
nieces' bat mitavah this coming Saturday morning (twins) and needed to learn
it again. I'm late deafened and haven't heard it in a long time.
<br><br>

I found your web site and though I can't hear much, your audio
files are so clear and precise, I can understand enough to do a decent
blessing. The pronunciation is incredible and I could follow most of
it. I was terrified of getting up in front of the congregation without
being able to hear, but your web site has given me the refresher I
needed and the confidence to enjoy my honor.
<br><br>

Thank you so very much for putting this on the web where people
like myself can access it as much as they need. God bless you and
L'Shana Tovah.
<br><br> 
Sincerely,
<br>

Shalom Rav!!! 

You have provided me with one of the most beautiful gifts!!!!II have no words to
express my joy and gratefulness .Finally I can learn to daven properly.<p>

I just recently found close family in the US after almost 60 years..believing this long time that I
was the only survivor. With my newfound family I also get the information that I am the 16th
generation in direct line of the Rav Low - the Maharal of Prag. The chain is not broken....and I am
not a Jew for nothing.....<p>

My brother Jiri thaught me the S'hma in Birkenau telling me it would save
my life -- Jiri was hanged a few days before the Russians liberated the KZ. He was 13...
Listening to some of the audios of the website brought him very close to me again....

Rabbi,<br><br>

The updated site is beautiful. Thanks for adding the additional
selections. 
<br><br>
My 12-year-old daughter, preparing for her bat mitzvah and planning to
lead kabbalat shabbat that weekend, has been using your recordings to
reinforce her summers at Camp Ramah -- Berkshires. She really
appreciates your selection of melodies, as they are her favorites from
camp.
<br><br>
best wishes for continued success,

Thank you so much for sharing your web site with me and the
world! <br><br>
Although I do know alot of the melodies in the siddur, it is helpful
to know you are there for "fine tuning" of some  phases and words. I plan to
share your website with other congregants!<br><br>

Thank you again!<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>

I would like to thank you for this wonderful resource! <br><br>
I belong to a newly founded Conservative synagogue in Lisbon - Kehillat Beit Israel.  As we have no rabbi yet, 
I personally have always wished to daven appropriately in order to lead our Kaballat Shabbat services, 
and your web page has been an immeasurable help! May HaShem bless you!<br><br>
Thank you so very much!<br><br>
